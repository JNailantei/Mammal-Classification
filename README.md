# Mammal-Classification

## Description

This project involves using a decision tree classifier to categorize animals as mammals or non-mammals. The classification is based on two datasets, `animals.csv` and `vertebrae.csv`, which contain relevant features for the classification task.

## Datasets

### `animals.csv`

This dataset contains information about various animals. Each row represents an animal with multiple features used for classification. The dataset includes features such as:

- `Feature1`
- `Feature2`
- `Feature3`
- ... (List all relevant features)

### `vertebrae.csv`

This dataset provides information about vertebral characteristics which are also used for classification. Each row represents a vertebra with features such as:

- `FeatureA`
- `FeatureB`
- `FeatureC`
- ... (List all relevant features)

## Installation

To run the notebook and use the datasets, you need to set up a Python environment with the following dependencies. You can use Google Colab for an easy setup.

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook and datasets.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
