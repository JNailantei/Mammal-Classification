# Mammal-Classification

## Description

This project involves using a decision tree classifier to categorize animals as mammals or non-mammals. The classification is based on two datasets, `animals.csv` and `vertebrae.csv`, which contain relevant features for the classification task.

## Datasets

### `animals.csv`

This dataset contains information about various animals. Each row represents an animal with multiple features used for classification. The dataset includes features such as:

- `Feature1`
- `Feature2`
- `Feature3`
- ... (List all relevant features)

### `vertebrae.csv`

This dataset provides information about vertebral characteristics which are also used for classification. Each row represents a vertebra with features such as:

- `FeatureA`
- `FeatureB`
- `FeatureC`
- ... (List all relevant features)

## Installation

To run the notebook and use the datasets, you need to set up a Python environment with the following dependencies. You can use Google Colab for an easy setup.

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook and datasets.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab notebook Mammal_Classification.ipynb.
Follow the steps in the notebook to load the datasets and preprocess the data.
Train the decision tree classifier on the datasets.
Evaluate the model and observe the classification results.
Here is a brief overview of the code in the notebook:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load datasets
animals_df = pd.read_csv('animals.csv')
vertebrae_df = pd.read_csv('vertebrae.csv')

# Data preprocessing and feature selection
# ...

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the decision tree classifier
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
